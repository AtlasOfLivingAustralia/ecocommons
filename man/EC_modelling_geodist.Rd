\title{Function to run Geographic Distance within EcoCommons. It is a geographical
model to predict a species by assuming that a species is more likely to be
found closer to an occurrence record. It uses the biomod2 package on R to set
up parameters, dismo functions, and the input data generated on the EcoCommons
platform.}

EC_modelling_geodist(a, response_info, predictor_info, dataset_info)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a list (S3?) created from a json file, containing $params & $env (formerly EC.params & EC.env)}
